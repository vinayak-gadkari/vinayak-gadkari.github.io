Personal Kanban on the desktop
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I have been a GTD (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">Getting Things Done</a>) fan as well as an agile practitioner for years. GTD advocates creating hard deadlines so that your slate is always clean. I have been finding this tough to manage as the WIP (work in progress) has been slowly increasing each day. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Personal-Kanban-Mapping-Work-Navigating/dp/1453802266">Personal Kanban</a> by Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry provided a refreshing view.</p>

Teams and Jira integration
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>If you are on the lookout for accessing Jira issues in Teams without asking the Jira administrator to install additional apps, Jira Server for Teams can be an option. The Jira Server connector uses built-in Webhooks functionality of Jira Server that doesn’t require third party Jira app installation. You still require the administrator for Webhook installation and also  configure firewall to allow outgoing traffic from Jira Server instance to Teams Connector app i.e. specifically need to add the address record of ‘connectors.msteams-atlassian.com’ to any sort of whitelist that controls network egress traffic..</p>
